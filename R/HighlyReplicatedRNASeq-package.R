#' HighlyReplicatedRNASeq: Collection of Bulk RNA-Seq Experiments With Many Replicates
#'
#' The HighlyReplicatedRNASeq package provides access to the count matrix results
#' from studies with many replicates. These datasets can be valuable for
#' benchmarking tools designed to handle RNA-seq data.
#'
#' Available datasets:
#'
#' + Schurch et al. (2016): 86 samples of S. *cerevisiae* in two conditions
#'   - [Schurch16()] / [Schurch16_metadata()]
#'
#'
#' At the moment, this package contains only one dataset, but more
#' datasets can be added in the future.
